### Git Cheery-pick

Git cherry-pick is a command used to apply a specific commit from one branch to another. It's particularly useful when you want to pick only certain commits instead of merging entire branches. Hereâ€™s how you typically use it:

1. **Find the commit hash**: Identify the commit you want to apply. You can find this using `git log` or by any other means to inspect your commit history.

2. **Switch to the target branch**: Make sure you are on the branch where you want to apply the commit. Use `git checkout <branch>` to switch branches if needed.

3. **Cherry-pick the commit**: Execute the command `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`. Replace `<commit-hash>` with the actual hash of the commit you identified in step 1.

For example:
```bash
git cherry-pick abc12345
```

4. **Resolve conflicts (if any)**: If there are conflicts between the changes introduced by the cherry-picked commit and the current state of the branch, Git will pause and ask you to resolve them. You can use `git status` to see which files have conflicts, resolve them manually, add the resolved files (`git add <resolved-file>`), and then continue the cherry-pick with `git cherry-pick --continue`.

5. **Commit the cherry-pick**: Once conflicts are resolved (if any), Git will commit the changes with a default commit message or a message you can specify with the `-m` flag.

6. **Continue or abort**: If you encounter problems during cherry-pick, you can abort it with `git cherry-pick --abort`.

**Note**: 
- Cherry-picking copies the changes introduced by the specified commit to your current branch. It does not merge the entire branch.
- Avoid cherry-picking commits that have already been merged into your branch to prevent duplicate commits and confusion in your repository history.

This command is handy in scenarios where you want to selectively apply changes from one branch to another, such as backporting bug fixes or applying specific features developed in parallel branches.
